About
~~~~~

SlepemapyAnalysis is a Python tool for data analysis, map drawing and
graph drawing. It uses data obtained from users learning geography
through interactive system available on Slepemapy_. Each class has
specific role:

-  Importer is responsible for loading and parsing csv into pandas
   DataFrame
-  Analysis is used for general calculations on DataFrames, most of the
   methods return pandas Series objects
-  Map is responsible for drawing choropleth maps in .svg format through
   kartograph. It has separate methods for drawing, legend, title,
   classification methods etc.
-  Graph class is used for drawing graphs
-  Every classesâ€™ frame is customizable, so that you can create your own
   frame and pass it on to these classes to draw/do more analysis on
   them.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the requirements are listed in requirements.txt. Some of them
(namely `GDAL`_, `kartograph`_) will probably not install automatically
through pip.

You will also need the csv user data, csv with country codes (included
in `/base/`_) and shapefile data for map regions. These shapefiles are
available on `Natural Earth Data`_ (world map included in
`/base/ <../blob/master/base/ne_110m_admin_1_countries>`__).

Usage example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I want to draw a map for specific user\_id with my own binning\_function
and my own number of bins (5)

Parsing phase:

-  input = Importer()
-  codes = input.load\_general\_csv(path\_to\_areas\_csv)
-  csv = input.load\_geo\_csv(path\_to\_user\_data\_csv)

Map drawing phase:

-  m = Map(output\_path,csv,codes,\ **user=user\_id**) #create map
   object
-  m.number\_of\_answers(binning\_function=\ **binning\_function**,number\_of\_bins=\ **5**)

There are also few examples of usage for predefined maps and graphs
included in main.py
