About
~~~~~

SlepemapyAnalysis is a Python tool used for data analysis, map and graph
visualisations. It uses data obtained from users learning geography
through adaptive system available on `Slepemapy`_. Each class has
specific role:

--------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the requirements are listed in requirements.txt. Some of them
(namely `GDAL`_, `kartograph`_) will probably not install automatically
through pip.

You will also need the geography.answer.csv, geography.places.csv and
shapefile data for map regions. The shapefiles are available on `Natural
Earth Data`_.

--------------

Usage example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 3 types of filtering: by user, by place, global. Then there
are also 2 types of visualisations - maps and graphs. You can combine
those to generate predefined graphs/maps by call from commandline:
python [graphs/maps]-[user/place/global].py -i â€¦

So for example, if you want to generate graphs for 5 specific users, you
can run from commandline: python graphs-user.py -i 10 25 2277 96 156
