Welcome to Slepe Mapy Analysis's documentation!
===============================================
SlepemapyAnalysis is a Python tool used for data analysis, map and graph visualisations. It uses data obtained from users learning geography through adaptive system available on `Slepemapy`_.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the requirements are listed in requirements.txt. Some of them (namely `GDAL`_, `kartograph`_) will probably not install automatically through pip.

You will also need the data from geography.answer.csv, geography.places.csv and shapefiles of regions. Included shapefiles are originally from `Natural Earth Data`_.


Usage example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| There are 3 types of filtering: by user, by place, global. There are also 2 types of visualisations - maps and graphs. You can combine those to generate predefined graphs/maps by call from command line:
| python [graphs/maps]-[user/place/global].py -i â€¦

| So for example, if you want to generate graphs for 5 specific users, you can run from commandline:
| python graphs-user.py -i 10 25 2277 96 156

Those generators expect you have geography.answer.csv and geography.places.csv
